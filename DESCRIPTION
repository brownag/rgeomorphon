Description: A fast and low-dependency implementation of the 'geomorphon' 
  terrain form classification algorithm of Jasiewicz and Stepinski (2013) 
  based largely on the 'GRASS GIS' 'r.geomorphon' module. This implementation
  employs a novel parallel algorithm, written in C++ and without external 
  dependencies.
